## **Description** 📖

Since the pandemic, there have been healthcare workers who find themselves under a lot of pressure due to uncertain times and feel extremely anxious and stressed during their day to day roles. Many healthcare workers are often overwhelmed from their day to day tasks and are constantly on the go that sometimes it becomes difficult to place your stress somewhere. Although meditation can seem like a great place to start, studies show that there is more thought process with journaling.

OffLoad is designed to create a safe place to track your emotions and identify your day to day stress points to make you become more self aware of certain trigger points.
